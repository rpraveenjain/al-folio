During my PhD studies, and now that I am nearing its completion, a thought that has always crossed my mind is that of - the Purpose of Life. I am sure many go through the same phase of what one might call an 'existential crisis'. The answer to this seemingly simple question of profound importance, has eluded me - leading to countless cycles of frustration, anger, resentment and sometimes, a new found joy, motivation, although short lived. The first in the series of blogs - "Purpose of Life", I make an attempt to answer, the way I see it and write down the thoughts that helped me, as and when they occur.

#### A story to begin with...

It was somewhere between February - April of 2010. I was in my final semester of the bachelors degree, working on my project (also my first Robotics project) at the Robotics lab of Nitte Meenakshi Institute of Technology. A visit of then Director of the Centre for AI and Robotics (CAIR), Defence and Research Development Organization was scheduled and we were expected to present our work. The project I was working on was sponsored by CAIR, hence his visit was of importance to the lab. After the short demonstration, my supervisor, also the Dean of research and development at the institute - the most enthusiastic lady I ever met (until now), said to the Director - "I have asked this guy to stay here with the lab as Research Associate after his bachelors". This was the first job offer of my life, announced right in the presence of the director of CAIR. Needless to say I was happy. At that time, I was going through the same 'existential crisis', what does one do after Bachelors? A common answer was - get 'placed' at an MNC, many jobs in IT, after all I lived in Bangalore. But deep inside I didn't want that. He said - "You might not get the money that MNCs pay staying here (at the lab), but you will know where you will stand 10 years later if you work with her (my supervisor)". Those words cleared things for me in an instant. I took his advice and later went on to stay in the lab for three years. Three very crucial years - years that changed my life forever.

The year 2020 marks 10 years, since he said that - more than a year to go. I am curious. Nervous. Excited. What could change in another year? A lot, or nothing at all. Time would answer.

#### Influence

Those words, just changed the course of my life. I took up engineering, because it was a trend. Following the trend, I thought, dreamt that I would land up at an MNC making decent money. But here I am pursuing PhD after a wonderful Masters degree, at an alien land, away from home. Something, neither me nor my parents ever imagined would happen - me travelling around the globe. A fact that me and my parents cannot fathom, even as of this writing.  A simple sentence, a simple action - can make so much of a difference to ones life. He probably (surely) himself doesn't know, that a person somewhere in the world, held onto those words, took a decision that drastically changed the pre-conceived path and is eagerly waiting to see what happens 10 years later.

The Purpose of Life - the way I see it, is certainly to be an influence, to conduct oneself such that our words, our actions have a lasting influence on people we come in contact with. If we were to ever influence any of the people, the way I was influenced - then a simple action, simple words can go a long way to create a chain reaction - growing exponentially in effect, over time, long after we are gone. The simple action, simple words, that might seem insignificant at the moment, but its effect lives on for eternity.  A simple ripple that we create at the present, could lead to a tsunami of positivity, somewhere in the future.

So where is the existential crisis? I think the crisis lies in our inability to see the bigger picture, our inability to understand the consequences (good or bad) of our actions, words. Inability to understand the importance of the task we perform, even if it seems mundane. Clearly, what one can do at the moment is to perform whatever needs to be done with utmost attention, presence and good intentions - knowing that every step that we take has an eternal impact on the 'existence'. The impact that would be felt for generations to come.

After all, I joined the Robotics lab due to a nudge (read influence) given to me by a dear one, moved abroad due to influence of my parents and aunt, and so on. For all that is happening in our lives, all that we are doing at this time, everything - is a product of INFLUENCE.

Keep influencing, Love.
