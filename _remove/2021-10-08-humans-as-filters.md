There is a case to be made for being philosophical in thinking and bringing about the necessary attitude in our everyday lifestyle. By philosophical I do not mean endless, futile theorization of what is, although that may be relevant in an another space. Rather by philosophy I mean something that is in the lived experience and can add value to our day to day living. After all, the philosophy that can guide our lives are highly contextual and to a large extent are dictated by the experiences of the decisions we have made. That is the only way one can truly understand and relate to what is being said.
