#### Analogy

We eat whenever we are hungry and then go on with our work, allowing time for the food to get digested, treating the food that we eat as an energy source. This holds true when we have a healthy relationship with the food. However, if our relationship with the food is not in order, we indulge in emotional eating, develop an eating disorder. What would happen if we eat without restraint, allowing no time for the process of digestion, every single day? To put it mildly, our physical health takes a hit and in extreme cases throw up even, if we were to continue with the unhealthy patterns of eating. It doesn't matter if our diets are healthy or unhealthy, excessive consumption creates problem nevertheless. Consequently, we go on a dieting strategy - which involves some form of fasting in order to compensate for the excess indulgence. Fasting in order to detoxify the body, allow the digestive system to rest and reboot.

Let's consider a different situation - wherein we have developed an unhealthy habit of information consumption - a problem well experienced in this age of the internet where vast amount of knowledge is accessible and in abundance. In this post I allude to the productive use of the internet in order to learn new ideas, philosophies, self-help, productivity strategies, wealth generation and the ideas of the kind that are subjective in nature. So what happens when such a seemingly useful information is consumed without any restraint? Is it important to allow time for the knowledge to digest? Answer is a resounding yes. Unchecked consumption of information is akin to indulging in healthy foods. Toxic and sickening. The price paid is the deterioration of the self - body, mind and soul. Thus the need for information fasting.

Information Fasting detoxifies the mind, just as fasting detoxifies the body.

#### Addiction

Watching educational videos, documentaries, reading books, articles, listening to podcasts, conversations and similar activities are a way to consume ideas from others. Obvious, since these activities involve use of senses to acquire information external to the self. The ideas that are external to the self, or in other words the ideas that are not realized by the self, enters our psyche through the senses that are entry portals for the flow of information - from the external material world, to the internal spiritual or metaphysical world.

While the utility of such activities cannot be discounted, it is important to cut them out in entirety, for a certain period intermittently, stop and listen to our inner self for once. This activity of paying attention to the inner self is what I refer to as meditation. During meditation, at least in the initial days, chances are that the thoughts that arise, provided we observe carefully, are not truly ours. They are the thoughts that are borrowed from the things that we read, listened to or something that we watched. These thoughts are the consequences of constant, uninterrupted consumption of ideas - good or bad - from the external world, from other people, brought upon the self - which is as bad as binge eating. Information binging - an addiction.

#### Problem
<blockquote>
Excessive information consumption possesses the mind, kills original thought, impedes meaningful action.
</blockquote>

The content we consume, come from people that do not share the same life circumstances, responsibilities, capabilities, experiences and temperament as ourselves. Further, the context of these ideas are dissimilar, making space for misinterpretation. The ideas and advises are many, the suggested paths to achieve a particular goal are many - to the extent that it gets overwhelming. While these ideas might hold true in most of the cases, it is not uncommon to come up with ideas that work and go against the conventional wisdom. Such is the uncertainty of the life. The question then is whether a certain idea is truly ours or it is someone else's idea that has possessed our mind? Are we exercising our own inherent intelligence or we are merely borrowing knowledge from other sources? These questions are important because our actions are guided by our thoughts. If our thoughts are not truly realized by ourselves but rather influenced by others, then perhaps the actions that we take are not entirely our making, but for which we are completely responsible?

The issue with this uninterrupted consumption of ideas is that they are not processed (digested) or acted upon - infinite number of ideas stacked on the mental desk. Add to that the delusion that we are making productive use of the internet, that we are actually learning something. A perfect setup for a disorganized mind. On further processing, one finds that the ideas start to contradict each other and potentially backfire if acted upon without due diligence. One finds that there could be multiplicity of ideas that seem equally plausible, equally beneficial, but lead to significantly different actions. Further, there is no way to attest a fitness score to any of these ideas - leading to a confused, overwhelmed and a noisy mind. An overwhelmed mind births a devious child - lethargy, a state where one looses the ability to take meaningful action. An infinite loop of consumption that drains energy, resulting in procrastination, loss of focus, reduced attention span and enthusiasm towards our purpose. After all, how can one take a meaningful action, come up with original ideas, if all the time is devoted to the information consumption.

#### Solution
<blockquote>
Make information consumption subservient to the life's purpose.
</blockquote>

Would that mean one must quit consuming ideas from others, quit reading, drawing information from external world, even though of great merit, altogether? No. The key lies in making information consumption subservient to our purpose. The key lies in integrating ideas obtained from the external sources, through action towards achieving our purpose. Observe the consequences of such an action, analyze and convert the knowledge thus acquired into wisdom backed by the experiences and realizations of the self. And to cease further consumption of ideas until the present one has been thoroughly processed - integrated or discarded - depending on its utility. This is the phase where we allow our inherent intelligence, our life experiences to guide us. This is where we make necessary modifications to the consumed ideas thereby making them our own, that are truly aligned with our life circumstances and perhaps, over period of time, come up with ideas that are entirely our own - the ideas that are unique.

The refinement of knowledge obtained from external sources into wisdom - that is contingent on our observed experiences is a process that cannot be rushed and it takes time for the fruits to bear. Mind tricks us into believing that by consuming information, we are engaging in an intellectual pursuit, while in practice we are setting fertile grounds for a confused mind. It is possible that this perceived intellectual pursuit is just another form of procrastination. Precisely why it is essential to discriminate, to be critical, to truly own an idea by testing its utility. This can be achieved through information fasting - time periods where ideas are no longer consumed. Rather, chosen ideas are acted upon, allowing the experiences to be observed and contemplated. A necessary detoxification of mind from endless information consumption. This process that contributes towards organizing the mind, is essential to prevent noise, uncertainty, doubt and confusion entering our psyche in the first place.

The saying - 'you are the average of five people you spend most of your time with', applies to - 'you are the average of five sources of ideas you spend most of your time with'. People are ideas, make sure that the average is not zero, that they don't cancel out.
