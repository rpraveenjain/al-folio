This is my personal page.

I am enthusiastic about robotics, control theory, estimation theory, machine learning and all the relevant mathematical concepts. In addition, I am interested in philosophy and many other things I do not yet know.

Main purpose of this page is to write about my [musings](/musings) and [research-blogs](/researchblog), with myself as the intended audience. If the technology related posts are of use to anyone - that would be great!

While the [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=5CrPqpwAAAAJ&hl=en) page list my minuscule contributions, the blogs reflect what I have learnt - which will always outnumber my contributions.

<!--Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

#Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

#Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.-->
