Suffering is the force that is needed to forge a sword, it is the fire that is needed to purify gold, it is the friction that is needed to shine a diamond and a pre-requisite stimilus to a human that forges the character, purifies the soul, and a shining demeanor that takes on life with grace and elegance. It results in a human that is as genuine as diamond and oftentimes, removes the chaff from the grain. It is the glue that bonds the relationship to make it stronger and also the hammer that shatters a weak one. It is the ultimate test of character, it is an examination that life throws at you to determine how well you prepared during the times of peace and prosperity. It also determines the character of those around you, reveals their true colors when you truly suffer. It reveals who really valued you and who pretended to value you possibly because you were of some utility to them. In short, it reveals everything about the world, external and internal. It reveals the character of others and more importantly, your own character. Viewed with right perspective it provides meaning to your life and through you a gateway to provide meaning to others life - if you were to conduct yourself in such a manner.

#### A toxin called Comfort

I grew up 



In the modern world, there is an unimaginable urge to automate everything. Comfort is the goal. Constant engagement in hedonistic pleasures is the purpose of life. Growing up in the Indian society, which traditionally places the goal of attaining knowledge (of the self) at the pinnacle of purpose of life. Where, the objective was moskha, nirvana or enlightenment through knowledge, through assimilation or union with the truth is considered the greatest achievement - it is surprising such a society has degenerated to a hedonistic lifestyle, with the self completely succumbing to the senses, allowing them to dictate and rule the agency of the self. The worship of truth, honesty, integrity, discipline, responsibility, love, patience, perserverance and detached selfless work is replaced with the worship of gluttony, wrath, lust, sloth, greed, envy and pride. No wonder anything remotely hinting at discomfort is avoided unless they satisfy the senses resulting in the relationship of the self with world transactional. A system which prescribed the self to be the master of the mind, while the mind makes the senses subservient is replaced with senses being the master of the mind and the self rendered as a slave to the mind and hence the senses. Comfort is then the greatest ideal, a fragile fortress where we tend to wither for the rest of the life.
