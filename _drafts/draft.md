-- Watching educational videos, documentaries, reading books, articles, listening to podcasts, conversations with others and similar activities are a way to consume ideas of others. Obvious, since these activities involve use of senses to acquire information external to the self.

The ideas that are external to the self, or in other words the ideas that are not realized by the self, enters our psyche through the senses that are entry portals for the flow of information - from the external material world, to the internal spiritual or metaphysical world.

While the utility of such activities cannot be discounted, it is important to cut them out in entirety, for a certain period intermittently, stop and listen to our inner self for once. This activity of spending time with oneself and paying attention to the inner self is what I refer to as meditation.

During meditation, at least in the initial days, chances are that the thoughts that arise, provided we observe carefully, are not truly ours. They are the thoughts that are borrowed from the things that we read, listened to or something that we watched.

These thoughts are the consequences of constant, uninterrupted bombardment of ideas - good or bad - from the external world, from other people, brought upon the self by constant consumption - which I think is as bad as binge eating or binge watching. An addiction.

The content we consume, come from people that do not share the same life circumstances, responsibilities, capabilities, experiences and temperament as ourselves. Further, the context of these ideas are dissimilar, making space for misinterpretation.  

While the ideas might hold true in most of the cases, it is not uncommon to come up with ideas that work and go against the conventional wisdom. Such is the uncertainty of the life.

The question then is whether a certain idea is truly ours or it is someone else's idea that has possessed our mind? Are we exercising our own inherent intelligence or we are merely borrowing knowledge from other sources?

These questions are important because our actions are guided by our thoughts. If our thoughts are not truly realized by ourselves but rather influenced by others, then perhaps the actions that we take are not entirely our making, but for which we are completely responsible?

My issue with this uninterrupted consumption of ideas, is that they pile up on the mental desk, awaiting processing. A perfect setup for a disorganized mind. On further processing, one finds that the ideas start to contradict each other and potentially backfire if acted upon.

One finds that there could be multiple ideas that seem equally plausible, equally beneficial, but lead to significantly different actions. Further, there is no way to attest a fitness score to any of these ideas. Leading to a confused, overwhelmed and a noisy mind.

One finds that there could be multiple ideas that in reality are incompatible, and yet are perceived as otherwise, leading to a distorted model of reality in our psyche, thereby compromising our decision making process.

An overwhelmed mind births a devious child - lethargy, a state where one looses the ability to take meaningful action. An infinite thinking loop that drains energy, resulting in procrastination, loss of focus and enthusiasm towards our purpose.

Would that mean one must quit consuming ideas from others, quit reading, drawing information from external world, eventhough of great merit, altogether? No. The key lies in making information consumption subservient to our purpose.

The key lies in integrating ideas obtained from the external sources, through action towards achieving our purpose. Observe the consequences of such an action, analyse and convert the knowledge thus acquired into wisdom backed by the experiences and realizations of the self.

And to cease further consumption of ideas until the present one has been thoroughly processed - integrated or discarded - depending on its utility. This is the phase where we allow our inherent intelligence, our life experiences to guide us.

This is where we make necessary modifications to the consumed ideas thereby making them our own, that are truly aligned with our life circumstances and perhaps, over period of time, come up with ideas that are entirely our own. Ideas that are unique to us.

The refinement of knowledge, obtained from external sources, into wisdom - that is contingent on our observed experiences is a process that cannot be rushed and it takes time for the fruits to bear.

Mind tricks us into believing that by consuming information, we are engaging in an intellectual pursuit, while in practice all we are doing is setting fertile grounds for a confused mind. Precisely why it is essential to discriminate, to be critical, to truly own an idea.

This process is essential to prevent noise, uncertainty entering your psyche in the first place. As it is said that 'prevention is better than cure'.

Finally, the saying - 'you are the average of five people you spend most of your time with', applies to - 'you are the average of five sources of ideas you spend most of your time with'. People are ideas, make sure that the average is not zero, that they don't cancel out.
