___Dharma___ is purely an Indian concept which, sadly has been mistranslated to mean ___Religion___ in English. Pathetic are the state-of-affairs that most Indians grow with this false notion of equating Dharma to Religion and propagate the same through the generations. Younger people, in their effort to look cooler, often consume all the trends that has backing of the pop-culture, declare themselves athiests and go on an endless tirade against religion - deriding all the Indic thoughts in the process without even understanding the very own thing, that they fight against. I have seen no other culture that is as self-sabotaging as the current Indian society. All that is left of the society, are people that blindly adhere to their often poorly understood philosophy, practicing as they deem fit, according to their convenience in order to get a false sense of status within society. The morals are for others and not for themselves it seems. Consequently, in the absence of independent thought, corruption of morals and values, one is left with a facade of being ___Dharmic___ and deeping embedded within are corrupted thoughts, corrupted actions giving rise to customs and traditions that are outright wrong.
