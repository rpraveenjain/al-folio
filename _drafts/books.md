Books are man's best friend, I am told. I vehemently disagree. They are not. A ___discerning___ mind, and selected books as a consequence of the discerning mind are a man's best friend. Discerning being the key word here. Books are not sacred, holy things that descend from the sky, delivered to us by the gods, rather they are collection of letters, words, sentences, paragraphs and chapters, written by humans reflecting their experiences, thoughts and values. There is wisdom in an old adage - "You are an average of five people you spend most of your time with". Just as one needs to be discerning with the friends they choose, the thoughts they consume, I see no reason why the same principle must not be applied to the books one reads.
